# Instructions for default_tutor.png

For the default tutor image, you'll need to create a placeholder image file at:
static/images/default_tutor.png

You can use any image editing software to create a simple avatar-style image with dimensions of 150x150 pixels. Alternatively, you can download a free placeholder avatar from sites like:
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://pixabay.com/
- https://unsplash.com/

Make sure the image is:
1. Square (1:1 aspect ratio)
2. At least 150x150 pixels in size
3. Saved as PNG format with the filename "default_tutor.png"
4. Placed in the static/images/ directory

This default image will be shown when no tutor image is available.
